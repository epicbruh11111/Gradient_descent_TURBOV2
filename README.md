# Gradient_descent_TURBOV2
This project is the V2 better version of the "https://github.com/epicbruh11111/Gradient-Descent_Ml" made by Ark This version will have two things, C support,and cython/pyhton(still under development)  

# Versions:

- v1: completed the C module & the C code
- v0.5: C code being created + integrating mathametical algorithims in C  

# Motive:

I love creating stuff(duh) which has some complex and unique interaction in out daily lives so I started out with  
creating the python-GD, but then after I got more deep into linux and low level stuff I created a simple C++ file 
however it wasn't supportive so this is a rebrand for the C x python project where I'll create a python library written
in C as it makes me better at complex algorithims & helps me improve in C because I want to contribute to the linux 
kernel as a hobby by using the C langauge to do my actual career in data science and ML in general

# Notice:

the C library requires to manual add the /Module folder and compile the GDmod.c with the main file/files with the main file 
importing the GDmod.h  
this C library is tested using GCC so its recommended to compile the code in GCC. It's fine to use another compiler but you'd have to manualy debug
any compiling errors or do a pull request with the problem to find the solution

Feel free to use the project and add your own implementation and take credits for it as this project is not serious 
and just a nice resume decorator for my skills.
